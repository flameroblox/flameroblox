THIS REQUIRES GCC COMPILER (TUT CAN BE FOUND AT https://www.guru99.com/c-gcc-install.html )

Step 1 − Open a new terminal window or cmd if you are on windows.

Step 2 − Change the directory to the directory in which you have your source.cpp file. For example, if it is in C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\Desktop\\YourFolder\\yourfile.cpp, enter your command line −
```
$ cd 'C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\Desktop\\YourFolder\\yourfile.cpp'
```
Step 3 − Now enter the following command to compile the source file using g++.
```
$ g++ -o <name-you-want-to-give> yourfile.cpp
```
In place of <name-you-want-to-give> replace it by any name like rodll, etc.

Step 4 − Run it! Now you can run the program using −
```
$ ./rodll
```
